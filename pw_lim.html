			<a href="https://8c2a4883.grocerystoresimulator.pages.dev/">Check out this grocery store simulator I made!</a>
			<ul class="p3";>
				<br>
				<li>During my senior year of highschool, I made this grocery store simulator for the higher support needs autistic high schoolers at my school as a part of my capstone project. The main intention of the simulator was to supplement the in-person field trips to grocery stores the class regularly took; the simulator would help the students develop and reinforce their money handling and shopping skills while the field trips would build upon that by adding the human interaction component to grocery shopping (interacting with employees, other customers, e.t.c).</li> <br>
				<li>In order to develop this website, I used the React framework (using Vite for routing between pages and Bootstrap 5 for styling), employing languages such as TypeScript (and JavaScript by extension), HTML, CSS, and JSON.</li> <br>
				<li>A HUGE THANK YOU to Ms.John for helping me so much with this project and giving me this opppurtunity to help my community.</li> <br>
				<li>ANOTHER HUGE THANK YOU to Asutosh Mishra for helping me so much with this project during its development.</li> <br>
				<li>AND ANOTHER HUGE THANK YOU to Mr.Lawrence and Ms.Corin also for this oppurtunity to help my community and for giving me feedback on my project throughout development.</li> <br>
				<li>AND AND ANOTHER HUGE THANK YOU to Mr.Lawrence and Ms.Corin's students for the help you guys provided when testing.</li>

		<a href="https://enzymes.tensegrity.workers.dev/">This is first ever website I made from scratch!</a>
			<ul class="p3";>
				<br>
				<li>For my midterm project in my Intro to Software Development class during my sopohmore year fo highschool, I created a website from scratch giving a very, very, very basic description of four different enzymes.</li><br>
				<li> Why did I choose Amylase, Helicase, Lipase, and Phosphofructokinase specifically?</li><br>
				<li> As much as I want to say "beats me, I don't know", I acutally had a reason . . . for some of them.</li><br>
				<li> For Amylase, I chose that one because it was (and still is) my favourite enzyme. I knew enough about it to write a little blurb for it, so on my website it went.</li><br>
				<li> On the other hand, I chose Helicase and Lipase because we had just learnt about both in biology the year prior. Just like Amylase, I knew a decent amount to write a little blurb about them.</li><br>
				<li> Phosphofructokinase was only in there because I felt that it would be a bit disingenious if I only put three enzymes in my website for my final project, so I chose an enzyme I knew nothing about.</li><br>
				<li> (If you couldn't tell, I had an enzyme hyperfixation during the first half of high school.)</li><br>
